This application takes in the user's grades as well as grade portions
in order to calculate what scores they need to acheive for the remaning
percentage of the class in order to acheive every grade between an F to
an A+. I originally wrote it in Java, and now am adapting it to C++. 
Function headers are stored in a header file and function definitions
are in a seperate cpp file from the main.
